# interpreter_in_rust

After reading Ruslan Spivak's "Let's Build a Simple Interpreter" in Python, it inspired me to write my own interpreter. 
This project is a port of his interpreter implemenation to Rust as I go through the tutorial again. I also had a jumping off point thanks
to Chris Aumann's port of Thorsten Ball's Monkey from Go to Rust.

I'm still new to the Rust language so if you have any suggestions on how to improve the code then please feel free to fork this
and submit a pull request with suggestions!
